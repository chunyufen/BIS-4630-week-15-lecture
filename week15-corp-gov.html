# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; “The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total.” - Course Handbook.

* Practical meaning: 300 hours = **2.5 hours per day** x *5 days* x 24 learning weeks (Note: only 18 learning weeks for Hong Kong)

---

# Master's degree in UK

&gt; “[A] master's [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . . Postgraduate study is *much more independent* than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be *working by yourself for much of the time*.” - [Taking the plunge into the master's world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# Corporate Governance

* The term appeared in American law journals in the 1970s.

* Imported from USA to UK.

* Received widespread recognition in the Cadbury Report

---

# Cadbury Report 1992

* [Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance](http://bit.ly/1KRE27l)

---

# Cadbury Report 1992

* Scandals (e.g. Maxwell, Polly Peck) hit the City of London and the UK financial markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were followed shortly afterwards by the spectacular collapses of BCCI and Barings.

&gt; "...in May 1991 Sir Adrian Cadbury was asked to chair the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance by the Financial Reporting Council, the London Stock Exchange and the accounting profession."

---

# Cadbury Report 1992

&gt; "The Cadbury Committee reported in December 1992 and took the view that governance was not a matter for legislation, a view supported by the City establishment and the UK Government of the time."

&gt; "The Cadbury Report produced a Code of Best Practice, comprising 19 Provisions and 14 Notes dealing with board and committee structures, remuneration and financial reporting, and describing the appropriate relationship with auditors."

---

# Cadbury Archive

* The [Cadbury Archive at Cambridge Judge Business School](http://bit.ly/2kAGvO2) consists of papers compiled and preserved by Sir Adrian Cadbury from his time as Chairman of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance.

---

# Rutteman Report 1994

* Internal Control and Financial Reporting - Guidance for Directors of Listed Companies Listed in the UK

---

# Greenbury Report 1995

&gt; "Following Cadbury came the rise of the "fat cats" - senior executives of newly privatised utility monopolies who were able to pay themselves (or rather be awarded, by allegedly "independent" remuneration committees) remuneration packages which were felt to be both excessive and non-transparent."

&gt; "The Greenbury Committee was set up by the CBI (Confederation of British Industry) in January 1995 by way of response to these concerns with a brief to examine matters concerning directors? remuneration and to produce a code of best practice on these matters. The Greenbury Committee reported in July 1995 ..."

---

# Greenbury Report 1995

* [Directors' Remuneration](http://bit.ly/2emxid3) - Report of a Study Group chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury


---

# Greenbury Report 1995

&gt; "Its key findings were that Remuneration Committees made up of non-executive directors should be responsible for determining the level of executive directors' compensation packages, that there should be full disclosure of each executive's pay package and that shareholders be required to approve them. Remuneration should be linked more explicitly to performance, and set at a level necessary to 'attract, retain and motivate' the top talent without being excessive. It also proposed that more restraint be shown in awarding compensation to outgoing Chief Executives, especially that their performance and reasons for departing be taken into account."

---

# Hampel Report 1998

* [Final Report - Committee on Corporate Governance](http://bit.ly/2dOzQO6), January 1998

---

# Hampel Report 1998

&gt; " The benefits which had arisen from the work of the Cadbury and Greenbury Committees and the codes produced by them were widely acknowledged, but ...there had been some criticism that inadvertently their work had resulted in a so-called "box ticking" mentality in the approach to governance. In other words, if the letter of the codes had been observed and "ticked", the company was deemed to be in good condition."

---

# Hampel Report 1998

&gt; "In November 1995, following the recommendations of the Cadbury and the Greenbury Committees that a new committee should review the implementation of their findings, a Committee on Corporate Governance was established under the chairmanship of Sir Ronald Hampel, the then Chairman of ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). The Hampel Committee's final report was issued in January 1998." (brackets added)

---

# Combined Code 1998

* The work of Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel Committees lead to the issuing of the Combined Code 1998 by the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on 25 June 1998.

* [The Combined Code: Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice](/bit.ly/2e9Y8Fu) , derived by the Committee on Corporate Governance from the Committee's Final Report and from the Cadbury and Greenbury Reports


---

# Combined Code 1998

&gt; "It was the Hampel Committee's view that ...in future a general set of governance principles should be underpinned by a Code making provisions about specific items. Under the new Code, companies should say how they applied these "principles" ...The London Stock Exchange therefore once again altered the Listing Rules so as to require that companies should state in their annual reports how they applied the 18 "Principles" drafted by the Hampel Committee and to state whether they "complied" with 42 Provisions which underpinned the Principles. ...The new Code combining both Principles and Provisions was called "The Combined Code", and was published in June 1998."

---

# Turnbull Report 1999

* [Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code](http://bit.ly/2jDfBXc)


---

# Turnbull Report 1999

&gt; "In September 1999 the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales published a report on internal control in response to the ...the Combined Code, that companies should "maintain a sound system of internal control" and should conduct an annual review of "the effectiveness of the system of internal control"; the outcome of this review should then be reported to shareholders. The "Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control" ...was published in a short booklet. It contains number of lucid guidelines by which companies can introduce and maintain effective internal controls and better manage risk."

---

# Turnbull Report 1999

&gt; "Turnbull's recommendations were that directors detail exactly what their internal control system consisted of, regularly review its effectiveness, issue annual statements on the mechanisms in place, and, if there is no internal audit system in place, to at least regularly review the need for one."

---

# Post Enron 2003

* In response to these disturbing features of corporate life on both sides of the Atlantic, the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned three studies:

* (1) "a review conducted by Sir Derek Higgs of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors, which was published in January 2003"


* [Review of the role and effectie of non-executie diretors](http://bit.ly/1kkpsXZ)

---

# Higgs Report 2003

* [Review of the Role and Effectiveness of Non-Executive Directors](http://bit.ly/1RiVtTO)

* Make a number of significant recommendations to change the Combined Code 1998

* at least half of a board (excluding the Chair) be comprised of non-executive directors;

---

# Higgs Report 2003

* that those non-executives should meet at least once a year in isolation to discuss company performance (a move away from the clear preference for unitary board structures displayed elsewhere)

* that a senior independent director be nominated and made available for shareholders to express any concerns to

* that potential non-executive directors should satisfy themselves that they possess the knowledge, experience, skills and time to carry out their duties with due diligence

---

# Combined Code 2003

* [The Combined Code on Corporate Governance](http://bit.ly/1V91qpc), July 2003


* The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) - responsible for overseeing the Combined Code 1998 - took most of the recommendations from the Higgs Report and issued in July 2003 a new version of the Combined Code.

---

# Turnbull Guidance 2005

* [Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code](http://bit.ly/2jtHYDZ)


* The Turnbull Report was first published in 1999 and set out best practice on internal control for UK listed companies. In October 2005 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued an updated version of the guidance with the title 'Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code'. In September 2014 this was superseded by the FRC's Risk Guidance.

# Walker Report 2009

* [A Review of Corporate Governance in UK Banks and Other Financial Industry Entities, Final Recommendations](http://bit.ly/2kA2rc6) 26 November 2009 (Walker Report)

&gt; "This review was commissioned by the Prime Minister in February 2009 to examine board practices at UK banks, and later extended to other financial institutions, in response to the recent financial crisis and perceived imbalance between shareholders' limited liability for institutional debts and the effectively unlimited liability of the taxpayer when obliged to bail them out. 'Serious deficiencies in prudential oversight' were noted, along with 'major governance failures within banks', but still promotion of best practice rather than formal regulation is identified as the best means to ensure ownership of good corporate governance"

---

# Walker Report 2009

* Comprises of five key themes:

    + that the prevailing unitary board structure and FRC Combined Code remain 'fit for purpose'

        + unitary board: single board of directors, comprising executive and non-executive directors

        + two-tier board: two separate boards, the management (operating) board which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the business, consisting of executives only and led by the chief executive; the supervisory (corporate) board with a wider membership, responsible for the strategic oversight of the organisation and led by the chairman.

---

# Walker Report 2009

* Comprises of five key themes:

    + that deficiencies in board practice are predominantly of behaviour rather than organization, and that a process of challenging the executive needs to be embedded, a responsibility laid at the door of non-executive directors

---

# Walker Report 2009

* Comprises of five key themes:

    + that active engagement remains a responsibility of shareholders and, in the case of mutual funds, a commitment to a Stewardship Code

    + substantial enhancement is necessary of board level oversight of remuneration of all senior employees (not just board level), to be more closely aligned with medium and long-term risk and performance

---

# Walker Report 2009

* 39 Recommendations

* Board size, composition and qualification

    + Recommendations 1 to 5

* Functioning of the board and evaluation of performance

    + Recommendations 6 to 13

* Role of institutional shareholders: communication and engagement

    + Recommendations 14, 16 to 18, 18B, 19 to 20, 20B, 21 to 22 (draft Recommendation 15 deleted)

---

# Walker Report 2009

&gt; "Corporate culture consists of "values", "belief" and "standards" effecting thoughts and behaviour of people in enterprises. They are key factors used to describe corporate culture. The corporate culture determines how employees describe where they work, how they understand the business, and how they see themselves as a part of the organization. Culture is also a driver of decisions, actions, and ultimately the overall performance of the organization, whether it is private or public sector."

&gt; "Despite significant interest in corporate culture, empirical research on this topic has been limited in the finance literature mainly due to measurement difficulties. Recently, some headway has been made to measure corporate culture and assess its impact on corporate behaviour. For instance, several studies (e.g., Hilary and Hui, 2009; Grullon, Kanatas, and Weston, 2010; McGuire, Omer, and Sharp, 2012) use local geographic culture measures such as religiosity around a firm's headquarters, while Bereskin, Campbell, and Kedia (2014) use firm-level data on corporate philanthropic activities and Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015) use responses from employee surveys administered by the Great Place to Work Institute."

# A Model for Analysing Culture

* Vogelsang, et al. (Ed). Handbook for Strategic Human Resources, AMCOM, Chapter 32 (by E. H. Schein)

&gt; "Whether one chooses to analyze culture as a state or as a process, it is helpful to differentiate the levels at which culture as a shared phenomenon manifests itself. Any group, organization, or larger social system can be analyzed in terms of (i) its visible and feelable 'artifacts,' (ii) its espoused beliefs and values; and / or (iii) its less visible, taken for granted shared basic assumptions"


* Artifacts:

&gt; "The visible, hearable, feelable manifestations of the underlying assumptions, e.g., behaviour pattern, rituals, physical environment, dress codes, stories, myths, products, ect."

---

# A Model for Analysing Culture

* Shared values:

&gt; "The espoused reasons for why things should be as they are, e.g., charters, goal statements, norms, codes of ethics, company value statements."

* Shared basic assumptions:

&gt; "The invisible but surfaceable reasons why group members perceive, think, and feel the way they do about external survival and internal integration issues, e.g., assumptions about mission, means, relationships, reality, time, space, etc."

# Director duties

* Codification

* general duties of directors are set out in ss. 171 to 177

* owed by directors to and enforceable by the company, not to shareholders individually, nor to stakeholders or other third parties

* follows the old English law principle that only the company itself can sue its directors, present or past, for breach of duty

---

# Director duties

* General duties

* the duty to act in accordance with the company's constitution, and only to exercise their powers for the purposes for which they are conferred (s.171)

* the duty to promote the success of the company (s.172)

* the duty to exercise independent judgment (s.173)

* the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (s.174)

* the duty to avoid conflicts of interest (s.175)

* the duty not to accept benefits from third parties (s.176)

* the duty to declare their interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement (s.177)

---

# Director duties

* Promote success of company (s. 172)

&gt; "Under s.172, a director of a company must act in the way the director considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole."

&gt; "the primary and overriding duty is to members (i.e. shareholders) "as a whole", that is, all the members of the company, majority and minority, present and future."

&gt; "in fulfilling this duty a director is required to "have regard (amongst other matters)" to six factors"

---

# Director duties

* "Success of the company"

* The Attorney-General at the time of the Committee Stage of the Company Law Reform Bill (as what became the CA was then entitled) in the House of Lords ...:

&gt; "...what is success? The starting point is that it is essentially for the members of the company to define the objectives that they wish to achieve. Success means what the members collectively want the company to achieve. For a commercial company, success will usually mean long-term increase in value. ...A company's constitution and the decisions that a company makes can also go on to be more specific about what is the appropriate success model for the company. I have indicated that usually for a company it will be a long-term increase in value, but I can imagine commercial companies that would have a different objective as to their success. ..."
---

# Director duties

* "Success of the company"

* The Attorney-General at the time of the Committee Stage of the Company Law Reform Bill (as what became the CA was then entitled) in the House of Lords ...:

&gt; "Success can ultimately be determined only on a company-by-company basis, and it is impossible that it may change over time. ...who decides in those circumstances whether the success is taking place. We go back to the basic duty that it is for the directors, by reference to those things that we are talking about - the objectives of the company - to judge and to form a good faith judgment about what is to be regarded as success for the benefit of the members as a whole. It will be for the directors to determine; it is their good faith judgment that will matter, and they will need to look to the company's constitution, shareholder decisions and anything else that they consider relevant in helping them to reach that judgment.\"\"

# Director duties

* "members as a whole"

The Attorney-General at the time of the Committee Stage of the Company Law Reform Bill (as what became the CA was then entitled) in the House of Lords ...:

&gt; "The duty is to promote the success for the benefit of the members as a whole - that is, for the members as a collective body - not only to benefit the majority shareholders, or any particular shareholder or section of shareholders, still less the interests of directors who might happen to be shareholders themselves. That is an important statement of the way in which the directors need to look at this judgment that they have to make."

---

# Director duties

* Six factors
    + (a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long-term
    
    + the interests of the company's employees
    
    + the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others

    + the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment

    + the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
    
    + the need to act fairly as between members of the company

---

# Director duties

* Issues in exercising duties

    + no hierarchy is given to the various potentially conflicting interests within the 6 factors

    + no guidance to applying 6 factors, given that general duties are owed to the company and not to outsiders

    + what if duty to promote the success of the company is different from other interests within the 6 factors?

    + what is the meaning of "amongst other things"

---

# Director duties

* Paper trail &amp; delegations of powers

&gt; "directors need to consider not only monitoring the basis for their deliberations, decisions and actions, but also establishing appropriate processes where they delegate their powers; in the context of delegation, this means considering the scope of delegation, reporting obligations and provisions for monitoring."

&gt; "Company secretaries need to ensure that in board papers relating to material decisions and corresponding minutes of board and committee meetings attention is paid to tracking the wording of the section so as to show that the various factors have been taken into account - but without turning the whole thing into a mere box-ticking exercise"

---

# Director duties

* Which principle does s. 172 apply?

    + shareholder value
    
    + enlightened shareholder value
    
    + stakeholder or pluralist approach

---

# Director duties

* Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (s. 174)

* This duty codifies the director's duty to exercise reasonable, care, skill and diligence.

* A director owes a duty to his company to exercise the same standard of care, skill and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent person with:

* the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as the director in relation to that company (an objective test); and

* the general knowledge, skill and experience that the director actually has (a subjective test).

---

# Director duties: components of duty of care

* What does a director need to know

* What standard does a director need to reach

&gt; "The duty under s.174 is owed, like the other general duties, (individually or collectively), but breach of the duty may indicate unfitness to manage a company and thus provide grounds for a director to be disqualified under s.6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986."
---

# Director duties: knowledge

* to become familiar with the business of the company

* to guide and monitor the management of the company

* to ensure regular attendance at board meetings

* to get outside specialist advice on issues of substantial importance

* to ask searching questions of managers
---

# Director duties: knowledge

* to understand the regulatory environment in which the company operates and measures taken to comply with that environment

* not to "shut eyes" to corporate misconduct

* to remember that there is an affirmative duty to seek out knowledge (for non-executive directors, there is a duty to challenge information provided by executive officers.)
---

# Director duties: standard

* Objective

* Subjective

    + The subjective test recognises that some directors may have special knowledge, skill and experience, in which event they will be required to conform to that standard.

* Summary

 &gt; "A director must observe whichever is the "higher" of these tests applicable to him in any particular case, i.e. the director must always observe the "objective" standard ..., but if he or she has special knowledge, skill and/or experience, a higher standard is required of him or her."

* Section 414C Contents of strategic report

&gt; "(1) The purpose of the strategic report is to inform members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 172 (duty to promote the success of the company)."

&gt; "(2) The strategic report must contain (a) a fair review of the company's business, and (b) a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company."

&gt; "(3) The review required is a balanced and comprehensive analysis of (a) the development and performance of the company's business during the financial year, and (b) the position of the company's business at the end of that year, (both (a) and (b) being) consistent with the size and complexity of the business."

* Head of Risk

* Chief Risk Officer

---

# Chief Risk Officer and independent risk management function

&gt; "Each firm must determine how best to achieve a strong corporate "risk voice", and often this has been successfully done by having the CRO report directly to the CEO. Some CROs are also given a seat on the board."

&gt; "Whether or not the CRO is a board member, many firms require the CRO to report regularly to the full board to review risk issues and exposures, as well to a risk committee if one exists. "

---

# Tasks of CRO

&gt; "ensuring that the firm has a robust and consistent risk management and control framework"

&gt; "providing support, oversight and challenge on the firm's risk appetite statements'

&gt; "owning the top-level strategic risk assessment process"

&gt; "monitoring the firm's risk profile against its risk appetites"

---

# Tasks of CRO

&gt; "playing a leading role in defining and embedding the firm's risk culture including the provision of risk training across the firm"

&gt; "overseeing and challenging the risk and control self-assessment programme and the firm's scenario analysis used to capture unexpected extreme risks"

&gt; "providing a dotted or solid reporting line for risk representatives within the business -these are members of staff, also called risk champions, who are designated within the business itself to monitor a department's operational risks on behalf of the owning manager"

---

# Tasks of CRO

&gt; "working with other oversight functions such as Compliance and Audit to provide a comprehensive, robust and efficient assurance framework"

&gt; "helping to define, and subsequently challenge, the Key Risk Indicators used for risk monitoring"

&gt; "ensuring issues are properly escalated, assisting with root-cause analysis for incidents and losses, and tracking any associated actions and establishing trends in the causes of the firm's losses"

---

# Tasks of CRO

&gt; "testing risk models and key controls within the business, and recommending improvements"

&gt; "supporting and maintaining the operational risk system if one is used by the firm to capture and track risks, controls, losses, actions and key indicators"
